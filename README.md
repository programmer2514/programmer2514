### Hi there 👋
I'm a hobbyist full-stack developer who enjoys experimenting with new languages and writing QoL tools to help people. A majority of my programs have been for the [TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/users/calclover2514), but you can find my more recent/non-calculator projects here.

A bit about me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on an ANSI shell for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator called [CEsh](https://github.com/programmer2514/CEsh)
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to contact me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/563652755814875146/) or by [Email](https://mailhide.io/e/kHCbTHeA)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can code in over 15 different programming languages
- ⭐ Pronouns: He/they (Or anything else, I'm not picky)
- 😄 I am now PCAP certified, yay!
